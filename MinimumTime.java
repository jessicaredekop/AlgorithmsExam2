 * class: MinimumTime
 * IDENTIFY- Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note
 * here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
 * DEFINE- Problem is clearly defined in "IDENTIFY"
 * EXPLORE- I'd convert every time into how many minutes into the day it is, and find the minimum of the minutes
 * subtracted to the given time, or added to the given time.
 * ANTICIPATE- I anticipate the time-complexity of this to be O(n).

 * LOOKBACK-
